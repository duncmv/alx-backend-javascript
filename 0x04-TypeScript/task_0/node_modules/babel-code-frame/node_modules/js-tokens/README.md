Overview [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lydell/js-tokens.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lydell/js-tokens)
========

A regex that tokenizes JavaScript.

```js
var jsTokens = require("js-tokens").default

var jsString = "var foo=opts.foo;\n..."

jsString.match(jsTokens)
// ["var", " ", "foo", "=", "opts", ".", "foo", ";", "\n", ...]
```


Installation
============

`npm install js-tokens`

```js
import jsTokens from "js-tokens"
// or:
var jsTokens = require("js-tokens").default
```


Usage
=====

### `jsTokens` ###

A regex with the `g` flag that matches JavaScript tokens.

The regex _always_ matches, even invalid JavaScript and the empty string.

The next match is always directly after the previous.

### `var token = matchToToken(match)` ###

```js
import {matchToToken} from "js-tokens"
// or:
var matchToToken = require("js-tokens").matchToToken
```

Takes a `match` returned by `jsTokens.exec(string)`, and returns a `{type:
String, value: String}` object. The following types are available:

- string
- comment
- regex
- number
- name
- punctuator
- whitespace
- invalid

Multi-line comments and strings also have a `closed` property indicating if the
token was closed or not (see below).

Comments and strings both come in several flavors. To distinguish them, check if
the token starts with `//`, `/*`, `'`, `"` or `` ` ``.

Names are ECMAScript IdentifierNames, that is, including both identifiers and
keywords. You may use [is-keyword-js] to tell them apart.

Whitespace includes both line terminators and other whitespace.

ECMAScript support
==================

The intention is to always support the latest stable ECMAScript version.

If adding support for a newer version requires changes, a new version with a
major verion bump will be released.

Currently, [ECMAScript 2017] is supported.

[ECMAScript 2017]: https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/8.0/index.html


Invalid code handling
=====================

Unterminated strings are still matched as strings. JavaScript strings cannot
contain (unescaped) newlines, so unterminated strings simply end at the end of
the line. Unterminated template strings can contain unescaped newlines, though,
so they go on to the end of input.

Unterminated multi-line comments are also still matched as comments. They
simply go on to the end of the input.

Unterminated regex literals are likely matched as division and whatever is
inside the regex.

Invalid ASCII characters have their own capturing group.

Invalid non-ASCII characters are treated as names, to simplify the matching of
names (except unicode spaces which are treated as whitespace).

Regex literals may contain invalid regex syntax. They are still matched as
regex literals. They may also contain repeated regex flags, to keep the regex
simple.

Strings may contain invalid escape sequences.


Limitations
===========

Tokenizing JavaScript using regexes—in fact, _one single regex_—won’t be
perfect. But that’s not the point either.

You may compare jsTokens with [esprima] by using `esprima-compare.js`.
See `npm run esprima-compare`!

### Template string interpolation ###

Template strings are matched as single tokens, from the starting `` ` `` to the
ending `` ` ``, including interpolations (whose tokens are not matched
individually).

Matching template string interpolations requires recursive balancing of `{` and
`}`—something that JavaScript regexes cannot do. Only one level of nesting is
supported.

### Division and regex literals collision ###

Consider this example:

```js
var g = 9.82
var number = bar / 2/g

var regex = / 2/g
```

A human can easily understand that in the `number` line we’re dealing with
division, and in the `regex` line we’re dealing with a regex literal. How come?
Because humans can look at the whole code to put the `/` characters in context.
A JavaScript regex cannot. It only sees forwards.

When the `jsTokens` regex scans throught the above, it will see the following
at the end of both the `number` and `regex` rows:

```js
/ 2/g
```

It is then impossible to know if that is
