# JSON5 – Modern JSON

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/json5/json5.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/json5/json5)

JSON is an excellent data format, but we think it can be better.

**JSON5 is a proposed extension to JSON** that aims to make it easier for
*humans to write and maintain* by hand. It does this by adding some minimal
syntax features directly from ECMAScript 5.

JSON5 remains a **strict subset of JavaScript**, adds **no new data types**,
and **works with all existing JSON content**.

JSON5 is *not* an official successor to JSON, and JSON5 content may *not*
work with existing JSON parsers. For this reason, JSON5 files use a new .json5
extension. *(TODO: new MIME type needed too.)*

The code here is a **reference JavaScript implementation** for both Node.js
and all browsers. It’s based directly off of Douglas Crockford’s own [JSON
implementation][json_parse.js], and it’s both robust and secure.


## Why

JSON isn’t the friendliest to *write*. Keys need to be quoted, objects and
arrays can’t have trailing commas, and comments aren’t allowed — even though
none of these are the case with regular JavaScript today.

That was fine when JSON’s goal was to be a great data format, but JSON’s usage
has expanded beyond *machines*. JSON is now used for writ
