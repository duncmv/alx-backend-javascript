/**
 * Singleton that provides a public API for a connection to a watchman instance for 'sane'.
 * It tries to abstract/remove as much of the boilerplate processing as necessary
 * from WatchmanWatchers that use it. In particular, they have no idea whether
 * we're using 'watch-project' or 'watch', what the 'project root' is when
 * we internally use watch-project, whether a connection has been lost
 * and reestablished, etc. Also switched to doing things with promises and known-name
 * methods in WatchmanWatcher, so as much information as possible can be kept in
 * the WatchmanClient, ultimately making this the only object listening directly
 * to watchman.Client, then forwarding appropriately (via the known-name methods) to
 * the relevant WatchmanWatcher(s).
 *
 * Note: WatchmanWatcher also added a 'watchmanPath' option for use with the sane CLI.
 * Because of that, we actually need a map of watchman binary path to WatchmanClient instance.
 * That is set up in getInstance(). Once the WatchmanWatcher has a given client, it doesn't
 * change.
