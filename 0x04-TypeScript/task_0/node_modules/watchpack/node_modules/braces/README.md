## Why use braces?

Brace patterns make globs more powerful by adding the ability to match specific ranges and sequences of characters.

- **Accurate** - complete support for the [Bash 4.3 Brace Expansion](www.gnu.org/software/bash/) specification (passes all of the Bash braces tests)
- **[fast and performant](#benchmarks)** - Starts fast, runs fast and [scales well](#performance) as patterns increase in complexity.
- **Organized code base** - The parser and compiler are easy to maintain and update when edge cases crop up.
- **Well-tested** - Thousands of test assertions, and passes all of the Bash, minimatch, and [brace-expansion](https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion) unit tests (as of the date this was written).
- **Safer** - You shouldn't have to worry about users defining aggressive or malicious brace patterns that can break your application. Braces takes measures t
